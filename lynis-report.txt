Step 1: Check and Fix Permissions on Sensitive Files
cd /etc
ls -l shadow gshadow group passwd

Result:
/etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow: -rw-r----- (root read/write, group read only or none)
/etc/group and /etc/passwd: -rw-r--r-- (root read/write, others read only)
Conclusion:
 File permissions are properly configured to secure sensitive user and group data.
Step 2: Create User Accounts
sudo useradd sam
sudo useradd joe
sudo useradd amy
sudo useradd sara
sudo useradd admin1

Step 3: Add Sudo Privileges to admin1
sudo usermod -aG sudo admin1

Result:
usermod -aG adds the user to the sudo group without removing others.
Step 4: Create a Group and Shared Folder
sudo groupadd engineers
sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

sudo mkdir /home/engineers
sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers
sudo chmod 770 /home/engineers

To confirm users were adding to the ‘engineers’ group:

Conclusion: This sets up a team folder only accessible to the ‘engineer’ group members.
Step 5: Run Lynis Auditclear
sudo apt update

sudo apt install lynis

sudo lynis audit system

Result:
Conclusion:
lynis scans your system and gives hardening recommendations.
