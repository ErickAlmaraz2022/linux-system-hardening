Title: Linux System Hardening

Project Overview:

This project focuses on auditing and hardening a Linux system using a hands-on approach. The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities in user management, file permissions, and system configurations,
then apply best practices to secure the system. The project concludes with a security audit using Lynis, a powerful open-source auditing tool, and provides recommendations for further hardening.

Obejectives:
* Understand and apply basic Linux system hardening techniques
* Verify and correct file permissions on sensitive system files
* Create and manage users and groups securely
* Assign administrative (sudo) privileges correctly
* Use Lynis to perform a system security audit
* Interpret audit results and apply recommended improvements
